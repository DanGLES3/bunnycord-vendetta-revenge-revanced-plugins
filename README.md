# Vendetta Plugin (yes, singular)
This repo is a fork of a fork. Yeah. This is a fork of [NarwhalKid's Revenge Plugins](https://github.com/NarwhalKid/revenge-plugin) repo, which itself is a fork of [Redstonekasi's Vendetta Plugins](https://github.com/redstonekasi/vendetta-plugins) repo.
I did not change any of the files from NarwhalKid's repo, and simply forked it to get the Actions for GitHub Pages to work, as to use the AudioFix plugin, all credits therefore go to them for fixing that plugin! Thank you so much! :) And thank you to Redstonekasi for the original plugin too!

# How to use:
Paste a plugin URL into the Plugins page of Vendetta, following a basic format of:

https://wintburr.github.io/bunnycord-vendetta-revenge-revanced-plugins/`PLUGIN_NAME`

Most importantly, this therefore will be:
https://wintburr.github.io/bunnycord-vendetta-revenge-revanced-plugins/AudioFix

Have fun :)
